# This file contains the main. All the functions you need to write are included in utils. You also need to edit the main.
# The main just gets you started with the data and highlights the high level structure of the project.
# You are free to modify it as you wish - the modifications you are required to make have been marked but you are free to make
# others.
# What you cannot modify is the number of files you have to save or their names. All the save calls are done for you, you
# just need to specify the right data.
